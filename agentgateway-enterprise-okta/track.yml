title: 'Enterprise Agentgateway + Okta: Identity-Aware AI Agents'
teaser: Build a production-grade AI gateway with real OAuth authentication, tracing,
  and scope-based MCP authorization.
description: "Your AI gateway is routing traffic and enforcing security policies.
  But in production, you need **identity** — knowing WHO is calling your agents and
  WHAT they're authorized to do.\n\nIn this advanced workshop, you'll build an identity-aware
  AI gateway from scratch using **Enterprise Agentgateway** and **Okta** as your identity
  provider. The cluster and Enterprise Agentgateway are pre-installed — you focus
  entirely on configuring the gateway.\n\nYou'll:\n\n- \U0001F527 Configure EnterpriseAgentgatewayParameters
  with tracing, logging, and extensions\n- \U0001F310 Create a Gateway with OpenTelemetry
  tracing connected to Grafana/Tempo\n- \U0001F916 Route real LLM traffic to OpenAI
  through the gateway\n- \U0001F50C Connect an MCP tool server and test with MCP Inspector\n-
  \U0001F511 Integrate Okta for JWT authentication with dynamic JWKS validation\n-
  \U0001F6E1️ Build CEL-based RBAC policies using Okta JWT claims\n\n**Prerequisites:**
  Familiarity with Kubernetes, Gateway API concepts, and basic OAuth/JWT understanding.
  Completing Tracks 1-3 recommended."
