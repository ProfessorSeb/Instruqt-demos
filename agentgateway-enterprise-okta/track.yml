title: 'Enterprise AgentGateway + Okta: Identity-Aware AI Agents'
teaser: Build a production-grade AI gateway with real OAuth authentication, tracing, and scope-based MCP authorization.
description: |-
  Your AI gateway is routing traffic and enforcing security policies. But in production, you need **identity** — knowing WHO is calling your agents and WHAT they're authorized to do.

  In this advanced workshop, you'll build an identity-aware AI gateway from scratch using **Enterprise AgentGateway** and **Okta** as your identity provider. The cluster and Enterprise AgentGateway are pre-installed — you focus entirely on configuring the gateway.

  You'll:

  - 🔧 Configure EnterpriseAgentgatewayParameters with tracing, logging, and extensions
  - 🌐 Create a Gateway with OpenTelemetry tracing connected to Grafana/Tempo
  - 🤖 Route real LLM traffic to OpenAI through the gateway
  - 🔌 Connect an MCP tool server and test with MCP Inspector
  - 🔑 Integrate Okta for JWT authentication with dynamic JWKS validation
  - 🛡️ Build CEL-based RBAC policies using Okta JWT claims

  **Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Kubernetes, Gateway API concepts, and basic OAuth/JWT understanding. Completing Tracks 1-3 recommended.
