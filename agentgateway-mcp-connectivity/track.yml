title: 'Agentgateway MCP: Secure Tool Access for AI Agents'
teaser: Connect AI agents to external tools securely using MCP and Agentgateway on
  Kubernetes.
description: "AI agents don't just talk to LLMs — they use **tools**. They fetch data,
  query databases, create issues, send messages. The Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  is the emerging standard for how agents connect to these tools. But who controls
  which tools an agent can use? Who rate-limits runaway agents? Who authenticates
  the requests?\n\n**Agentgateway** brings enterprise-grade security and governance
  to MCP traffic. Built on the Kubernetes Gateway API, it gives you a single control
  point for all agent-to-tool communication.\n\nIn this hands-on workshop, you'll:\n\n-
  \U0001F50C Understand what MCP is and why agents need it\n- \U0001F3AF Route MCP
  traffic through Agentgateway to a tool server\n- \U0001F310 Federate multiple MCP
  servers behind a single gateway\n- \U0001F512 Control which tools agents can call
  with fine-grained authorization\n- ⏱️ Rate-limit MCP requests to protect upstream
  APIs\n- \U0001F511 Secure MCP endpoints with OAuth/Keycloak authentication\n\n**No
  real API keys needed.** This track uses mock MCP servers so everything runs self-contained
  in your cluster.\n\n**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with Kubernetes basics (kubectl,
  pods, services). Completing the Agentgateway OSS Quickstart track first is recommended
  but not required."
