title: 'Secure OpenClaw with AgentGateway: Control and Govern Your LLM Traffic'
teaser: Deploy AgentGateway OSS on Kubernetes and wire it as a secure LLM proxy for
  OpenClaw — centralize API keys, add a kill switch, and gain full observability over
  your AI agent traffic.
description: "Your AI agent is calling OpenAI directly. Your API key is in an environment
  variable.\nYou have no idea how many tokens it's using, no way to stop it mid-flight,
  and no\nvisibility into what it's actually sending.\n\nSound familiar? We saw this
  exact pattern with microservices in 2016 — before service\nmeshes and API gateways
  brought order to the chaos.\n\n**AgentGateway** is the API gateway for AI agent
  traffic. It gives you a single control\nplane for every LLM call your agents make.\n\n**In
  this lab you'll learn:**\n\n- ❌ Why direct LLM calls are a problem (visibility,
  security, cost, governance)\n- \U0001F680 How to deploy AgentGateway OSS on Kubernetes\n-
  \U0001F511 How to centralize API key management so apps never touch credentials\n-
  ☠️ How to use AgentGateway as a kill switch to cut off LLM access instantly\n- \U0001F9E0
  How to register multiple model backends under one control plane\n- \U0001F50D How
  to observe and audit all AI traffic through your gateway\n\n**No prior AgentGateway
  experience required.**\nFamiliarity with Kubernetes basics (kubectl, pods) is helpful
  but not essential."
