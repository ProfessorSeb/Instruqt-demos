title: 'AI Agent Gateway: Control, Observe, and Govern Your LLM Traffic'
teaser: Learn why proxying LLM and MCP tool traffic matters — then build it. Deploy
  AgentGateway OSS and wire OpenClaw through it for full control over your AI stack.
description: |-
  Your AI agent is calling OpenAI directly. Your API key is in an environment variable.
  You have no idea how many tokens it's using, no way to stop it mid-flight, and no
  visibility into what it's actually sending.

  Sound familiar? We saw this exact pattern with microservices in 2016 — before service
  meshes and API gateways brought order to the chaos.

  **AgentGateway** is the API gateway for AI agent traffic. It gives you a single control
  plane for every LLM call and MCP tool invocation your agents make.

  **In this lab you'll learn:**

  - ❌ Why direct LLM calls are a problem (visibility, security, cost, governance)
  - 🚀 How to deploy AgentGateway OSS on Kubernetes
  - 🔑 How to centralize API key management so apps never touch credentials
  - ☠️ How to use AgentGateway as a kill switch to cut off LLM access instantly
  - 🔧 How to proxy MCP tool traffic — not just LLMs
  - 🤖 How to wire OpenClaw through the gateway for a complete AI assistant stack

  **No prior AgentGateway experience required.**
  Familiarity with Kubernetes basics (kubectl, pods) is helpful but not essential.
