title: 'AI Agent Gateway: Control, Observe, and Govern Your LLM Traffic'
teaser: Learn why proxying LLM and MCP tool traffic matters — then build it. Deploy
  AgentGateway OSS and wire OpenClaw through it for full control over your AI stack.
description: "Your AI agent is calling OpenAI directly. Your API key is in an environment
  variable.\nYou have no idea how many tokens it's using, no way to stop it mid-flight,
  and no\nvisibility into what it's actually sending.\n\nSound familiar? We saw this
  exact pattern with microservices in 2016 — before service\nmeshes and API gateways
  brought order to the chaos.\n\n**AgentGateway** is the API gateway for AI agent
  traffic. It gives you a single control\nplane for every LLM call and MCP tool invocation
  your agents make.\n\n**In this lab you'll learn:**\n\n- ❌ Why direct LLM calls are
  a problem (visibility, security, cost, governance)\n- \U0001F680 How to deploy AgentGateway
  OSS on Kubernetes\n- \U0001F511 How to centralize API key management so apps never
  touch credentials\n- ☠️ How to use AgentGateway as a kill switch to cut off LLM
  access instantly\n- \U0001F527 How to proxy MCP tool traffic — not just LLMs\n-
  \U0001F916 How to wire OpenClaw through the gateway for a complete AI assistant
  stack\n\n**No prior AgentGateway experience required.**\nFamiliarity with Kubernetes
  basics (kubectl, pods) is helpful but not essential."
