title: 'AI Dev Assistant: OpenClaw + AgentGateway LLM Gateway'
teaser: Deploy a personal AI assistant powered by OpenClaw and route all LLM traffic
  through an AgentGateway on Kubernetes — with full visibility and control.
description: |-
  Your AI assistant is making direct API calls to OpenAI with zero visibility, no cost control, and no governance. Sound familiar?

  **AgentGateway** is a purpose-built gateway for AI agent traffic. In this lab, you'll deploy AgentGateway as an LLM proxy on Kubernetes and wire it up to **OpenClaw** — a self-hosted AI assistant platform.

  **What you'll build:**

  ```
  OpenClaw (your AI assistant)
      ↓ HTTP (localhost:8080/v1)
  AgentGateway (LLM Gateway on k8s)
      ↓ HTTPS
  OpenAI API
  ```

  **In this hands-on lab, you'll:**

  - 🚀 Deploy AgentGateway OSS on Kubernetes using kind
  - 🔑 Configure an OpenAI LLM provider with a gateway-managed API key
  - 🤖 Install and configure OpenClaw as your personal AI assistant
  - 🔀 Route all OpenClaw traffic through AgentGateway
  - 💬 **BONUS:** Connect OpenClaw to WhatsApp for mobile access

  **No prior AgentGateway or OpenClaw experience required.**
