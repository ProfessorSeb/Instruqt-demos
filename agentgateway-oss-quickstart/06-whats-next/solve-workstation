AgentGateway OSS Quickstart - Workshop Recap

What I learned:
1. Direct agent-to-LLM calls create security and visibility gaps
2. AgentGateway provides a Kubernetes-native gateway for AI traffic
3. Built on Gateway API standard (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute)
4. Multi-provider routing through a single endpoint
5. Built-in observability with structured logs and Prometheus metrics

Architecture:
  Agent -> AgentGateway (Gateway API) -> LLM Providers
  
Key Resources:
  - GatewayClass: registers AgentGateway as an implementation
  - Gateway: the actual gateway instance (listeners)
  - Backend: LLM provider connection details + credentials
  - HTTPRoute: routing rules (path-based, header-based)

Next steps:
  - Try with real API keys
  - Explore AgentGateway Enterprise for security features
  - Set up Langfuse for full LLM observability
