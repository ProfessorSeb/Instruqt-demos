teaser: Deploy a purpose-built gateway for AI agent traffic on Kubernetes using the open-source AgentGateway project.
description: |-
  AI agents are calling LLMs and MCP tools directly — no visibility, no security, no cost control. Sound familiar? It's the same chaos we saw with microservices in 2016, before service meshes and API gateways brought order.

  **AgentGateway** is a purpose-built gateway for AI agent traffic. Built on the Kubernetes Gateway API, it gives you a single control point for all your agent-to-LLM communication — routing, observability, and governance included.

  In this hands-on workshop, you'll:

  - 🔍 Understand why direct agent-to-LLM calls are a problem
  - 🚀 Install AgentGateway OSS on a Kubernetes cluster
  - 🌐 Create your first AI Gateway with LLM routing
  - 🔀 Route traffic to multiple LLM providers (OpenAI + Anthropic)
  - 📊 Explore the observability AgentGateway provides out of the box
  - 🗺️ Learn what's possible with AgentGateway Enterprise

  **No prior AgentGateway experience required.** Familiarity with Kubernetes basics (kubectl, pods, services) is helpful.

          # The AI Agent Infrastructure Gap

          Think back to 2016. Microservices were exploding. Every team deployed services that called other services directly — no visibility into what was happening, no consistent security, no rate limiting.

          Then came API gateways and service meshes. Suddenly you had a **control plane** for service-to-service traffic.

          **We're at that same inflection point with AI agents.**

          Today, agents call LLMs directly. API keys are scattered everywhere. There's no audit trail. No way to enforce cost controls. No unified observability.

          Every agent team is solving these problems independently — badly.

          **AgentGateway** is the missing infrastructure layer. A purpose-built gateway for AI agent traffic, built on the Kubernetes Gateway API standard.

          Let's see the problem firsthand, then fix it.
