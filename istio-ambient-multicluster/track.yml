title: "Istio Ambient Multi-Cluster: Zero Trust Across Regions"
teaser: "Build a two-cluster ambient mesh with cross-cluster connectivity, authorization policies, waypoints, and production telemetry."
description: |-
  In this hands-on workshop, you'll build a production-grade Istio ambient multi-cluster mesh from the ground up.

  You'll start with two pre-configured Kubernetes clusters running Istio in ambient mode with a shared certificate authority. From there, you'll deploy applications across clusters, enroll them in the mesh for automatic mTLS, verify cross-cluster service discovery, enforce zero-trust authorization policies, deploy L7 waypoints where you need them, and configure production telemetry.

  By the end of this track, you'll understand:
  - How Istio ambient mesh eliminates sidecars while maintaining zero-trust security
  - How multi-cluster service discovery works with shared trust domains
  - The L4 (ztunnel) vs L7 (waypoint) architecture and when to use each
  - How to enforce authorization policies that span cluster boundaries
  - How to structure your mesh configuration for GitOps workflows
