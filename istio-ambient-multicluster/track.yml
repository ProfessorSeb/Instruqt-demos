title: 'Istio Ambient Mesh: Zero Trust Without Sidecars'
teaser: Deploy Istio ambient mesh, enroll workloads for automatic mTLS, enforce zero-trust
  policies, deploy L7 waypoints, and configure production telemetry.
description: |-
  In this hands-on workshop, you'll build a production-grade Istio ambient mesh from the ground up — on a single cluster, the way most teams actually start.

  You'll explore the ambient architecture (ztunnel for L4, waypoints for L7), deploy applications, enroll them in the mesh for automatic mTLS, enforce zero-trust authorization policies, deploy L7 waypoints where you need them, and configure production telemetry.

  By the end of this track, you'll understand:
  - How Istio ambient mesh eliminates sidecars while maintaining zero-trust security
  - The L4 (ztunnel) vs L7 (waypoint) architecture and when to use each
  - How to enforce fine-grained authorization policies
  - How to structure your mesh configuration for GitOps workflows
  - How to extend to multi-cluster when you're ready
